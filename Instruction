In this Program, the goal is to create a calculator capable of evaluating mathematical
expressions. The process consists of two fundamental steps: firstly, converting an infix
expression to a post expression, and secondly, evaluating the resultant postfix
expression.
In simple terms, an infix expression is the conventional way we write mathematical
expressions, where operators like +,-,*, and / are placed between the operands (e.g., 3
+ 4 * 5). On the other hand, a postfix expression, also known as Reverse Polish
Notation (RPN), places operators after the operands (e.g., 3 4 5 * + ). The significant
advantage of postfix notation is the elimination of parenthesis and the ambiguity
regarding the order of operations, making it a streamlined approach for computer
evaluation.
